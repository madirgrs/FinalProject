  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello! My name is Madi and I am a sophomore at the University of Missouri! I am currently majoring in Information Technology. Outside of school I work at Level Up, an arcade at the Columbia Mall. I also love music and constantly am trying to go to concerts. I am hoping to one day move somewhere cool and find a job working in game development and design. :)
